# Python Operators: operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

# 1. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
x = 7
y = 9

print(x+y) # addition
print(x-y) # subtraction
print(x*y) # multiplication
print(x/y) # divison
print(x%y) # modulus
print(x**y) # exponent
print(x//y) # floor divison

# 2. ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR:

s = 9
# += is same as s = s + 3
s += 3
print(s)

# -= is same as s = s - 2
s -= 2
print(s)

# *= is same as s = s * 2
s *= 2
print(s)

# /= is same as s = s / 5
s /= 5
print(s)

# %= is same as s = s % 6
s %= 6
print(s)

# //= is same as s = s // 4
s //= 4
print(s)

# 3. COMPARISON OPERATORS:
w = 4
z = 3
print(w == z) # Equal
print(w != z) # Not equal
print(w > z) # Greater than
print(w < z) # less than
print(w >= z) # Greater than or equal to
print(w <= z) # less than or equal to
